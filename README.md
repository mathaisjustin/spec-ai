# SpecAI

SpecAI is a **local-first, spec-driven AI development framework**, inspired by GitHub Spec Kit.

It treats:
- **Documents as the source of truth**
- **AI as a document transformer**
- **Humans as the final authority**

---

## Development Lifecycle

Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Review

Each phase produces concrete artifacts on disk.
Nothing relies on chat history or hidden state.

---

## Core Principles

- Document-first workflow
- Human approval gates at every phase
- Local LLM–first (Ollama, Qwen, DeepSeek)
- Model-agnostic by design
- No autonomous agents
- No hidden memory

---

## Status

🚧 **Coming soon**

The CLI foundation is being built incrementally with strict checkpoints.

Expect breaking changes until v0.1.

---

## Inspiration

Conceptually inspired by GitHub Spec Kit, but implemented from scratch without Copilot or hosted AI dependencies.

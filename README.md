# SpecAI

SpecAI is a **local-first, spec-driven AI development framework**, inspired by GitHub Spec Kit.

It treats **documents as the source of truth**, **AI as a document transformer**, and **humans as the final authority**.

🚧 This project is under active development. Expect breaking changes.

## Core Ideas

- Spec-driven lifecycle  
  Constitution → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Review
- Documents on disk are the only memory
- AI assists but never approves
- Local LLM–first (Ollama, Qwen, DeepSeek)
- Model-agnostic by design
- Explicit human approval gates

## Status

Coming soon. The CLI foundation is currently being built.

## Inspiration

Inspired by GitHub Spec Kit, but implemented from scratch and without dependence on Copilot or hosted AI APIs.
